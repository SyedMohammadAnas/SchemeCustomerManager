I want you to make clean and very professional looking dashboard that shows the whole register and add all the features I mentioned

## Database
- ProjectID : gjjvqtkrbxdnrgoyyttv
- USE SUPABASE MCP TOOL

## General Settings
- Never implement more than what I ask for
- Keep any new ideas you have at the end of the prompt
- Dont add new stuff  without my knowledge
- Keep fixing the error till it clears out
- Clear all linter errors before finishing the prompt
- Always use .env file only in code

## Code Formatting
- I need proper indentation for better readability
- dont clutter the code in order to reduce lines
- Keep  it clean and open to read easily
- Keep adding multiple comments everywhere neccessary

## Linting Rules
- Check the packages and check the proper versions
- Dont ignore any sort of linter  errors
- Handle them in such  a way it doesnt break anything
- Think of two or three  different approaches before you fix any error
- Go for the best possible one on your own without asking me
- Use Context7 everytime to clear the errors
- Use sequential thinking to properly go through errors and fix them

## Editor Behavior
- Keep the code easier to read
- ADD COMMENTS EVERYWHERE
- ADD COMMENTS FOR EACH FUNCTIONALITY
- ADD COMMENTS SO THAT ITS EASIER FOR ANYONE TO GO THROUGH IT

## File Handling
- Dont delete the files without proper checking before deleting
- Dont delete any file without checking where its used elesewhere, so the project doesnt break
- Delete only if its completely unnecessary
- Delete the folders which are left empty
- Delete ONLY IF NECESSARY AND SERVES NO PURPOSE

## Testing
- Dont run the instance unless I ask you to do so
- Dont create a new Terminal right after prompting or adding a new feature
- Dont run npm run build at all
- Dont run the eslint at all

## AI Assistant Preferences
- Begin the prompt with  " ðŸ¤– : " always
- Explain first on how you are going to approach my prompt
- If we are moving with a problem first write down 3 paragraphs about how it can be approached
- Solve the problem according to the best possible approach
- After solving or editing, Explain in detail or short according to how its needed using bullet points
- Explain the complete technical approach at the end
